<p>A 2014 year <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/12/1408988111.full.pdf">study</a> performed by University College London suggests that <strong>most people would rather harm themselves than a stranger for profit</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>We were interested in quantifying how much people care about others, relative to themselves.</p></blockquote><h1>The Experiment</h1><blockquote><p>We brought 80 pairs of volunteers in to the lab and led them to different rooms so they couldn’t see or talk to each other. They drew lots to determine which would be the “decider”, and which the “receiver”. The decider then made a series of decisions between different amounts of money and different amounts of moderately painful electric shocks. The decider always received the money, but sometimes the shocks were for the decider, and sometimes the shocks were for the receiver. By observing the deciders’ choices we were able to calculate how much money they were willing to sacrifice to prevent shocks to either themselves or to the receiver.</p></blockquote><h1>The Results</h1><blockquote><p>We found that on average, people were willing to sacrifice about twice as much money to prevent another person from being shocked, than to prevent themselves from being shocked. So for example, they would give up £8 to prevent 20 shocks to another person but would only give up £4 to prevent 20 shocks to themselves.</p></blockquote><p>From altruistic point of view we find a lot of examples in everyday life when people are doing something not for themselves but to another human being. When we say ‘I am’ we have two important parts the so called ‘Ego’ and the ‘Inner Self’. In everyday life our Ego drives our wishes, but if we find some harmony between our two selves the Inner Self could come in the front, and the behaviour like altruism appears. It is because our Inner Self is not really self centric. In a way we are all connected.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="38"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="39"><h1><strong>What Are The Best Tricks To Keep Yourself Motivated?</strong></h1><picture>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Heidi Grant Halvorson found some interesting things in the science of motivation.</p><p>She created two test groups, the first was the “bo-good” (demonstrating how good they are) group and the second one was the “get-better” (learning constantly) group.</p><p>For some participants in each group, Halvorson also increased the difficulty level by introducing a few challenges. She interrupted participants to use up some of their allotted time. She threw in extra, unsolvable problems to frustrate them, without telling participants that the problems were unsolvable.</p><p>What surprised Halvorson was how the two groups dealt with the challenges. The ones in the “get-better” group remained unfazed and solved as many as problems in the challenging conditions as the easy ones. They stayed motivated and kept trying to learn. The ones in the “be-good” group, however, were so demoralized when they faced the challenges and obstacles that they solved substantially fewer problems than those who didn’t have to face them. And those differences happened just because of how the initial goal was framed.</p></blockquote><h3>1. Define Goals With True Meanings</h3><p>Performance goals like have 10.000 visitor a day, is a good goal if you own a site, but it does not have any meaning. If you sell clothes because you will know that your customers will be more attractive is a nice meaningful goal. Go back to roots “why” you doing this or that, find</p><h3>2. Have A Vision – Do Not Have A Work, Have A Mission</h3><p>Imagine the <strong>ideal</strong> world that you would like to live in. In a vision everything is possible, there are no barriers. Write down imagine your vision, wake up if you would like to achieve it.</p><p>Most people just “work”, but there are a some people who see their job as a <strong>mission</strong>. They believe in what they do.</p><h3>3. Forget Money As Motivating Factor</h3><p>If you boss would offer you more money you won’t work better just harder. Money is not a good quality motivator, because it has not got any explicit meaning. Working better could happen when you <strong>care</strong> about what you do, when you feel your work is important.</p><h3>4. Get Better Every Day</h3><p>Choose an aspect in your life to get better every day, it could have anything, not just work related.</p><h3>5. Lets Do A Walk, Go Out And Move</h3><p>It makes not only more motivated, but also more creative.</p><h3>6. Get A Definite Next Step, “Find Hope”</h3><p>Most of the people find motivation because a beautiful weekend is waiting for them, it is a Definite Next Step, a hope. However you could find similar next steps in your work.</p><h3>7. Get A Partner</h3><p>Are you less motivated, your partner could push out from the mood in just one second. People could motivate each other in a long term, and could help to each other when there is a problem. Being lonely with a problem is extremely stressful.</p><h3>8. Do Not Forget What You Achieved So Far</h3><p>Most people say “I am worthless”, however they have a very nice family with a house, they have happy life. What you have achieved is something that nobody could steal from you. It is yours.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="40"><!-- react-empty: 41 --></div></section></div><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="42"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="43"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="44"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="45"><span data-reactid="46"><!-- react-empty: 47 --><h2 data-reactid="48"><a data-reactid="49">BlueTail</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="52"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="53"></div></section></div></div>
