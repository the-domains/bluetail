    and it could hurt really badly.<br>If someone is attractive to you, but you fear, that he or she won’t like you, and you miss the ask for a date, yes at the end, it will hurt badly.</p><p>Things changes constantly in our life. Nothing happens as we imagined, even if we well plan a date, and it is successful, I am 100% sure, that it does not happened as planned previously.</p><p>Take some time to think through where we fail in most cases, and reveal the acknowledgements:</p><h3>Relax your mind and body</h3><p>Before you start to anything, never forget to be relaxed, even if it is difficult. Start breathing calmly, and be prepared for everything that comes to you. I know it is contradiction, “How I could be prepared for everything?”, now that is why you should
    be relaxed. In sports that is why big sportsman try to relax every time, they are not in play. The key to success is, that you should be in a state of relaxation, it starts in your mind, and it will effect your body. If you are relaxed you will harder
    to get tired. The least resistance in your muscle, the least pain will emerge.</p><picture>

</picture><p>Do you remember the game dodgeball in your childhood? Life works exactly as dodgeball, there are four ways to act:</p><ol>
    <li>The ball strikes you, because you did not have the good reaction</li>
    <li>You avoid the hit, just by step away from the path of the ball</li>
    <li>You try to catch the ball, but it falls out from your hands</li>
    <li>You catch the ball, because your hands absorbs the energy of the throw</li>
</ol><p>The most successful players are able to catch the ball. They understand, that they should not stand tensely, rather being relaxed and act according to the situation.</p><p>In his book Dan Millman explains the above with his character Socrates, who learned to fight from his teacher Serafin:</p><p><em>- Please, Serafim, I don’t need you to constantly remind me to relax and breathe. I understand your point!<br>- <strong>Doing is understanding </strong>– Serafim said.</em><br><em>- In combat, there’s no time to think. Beforehand, you may plan and strategize, but all plans are tentative and must change on the spur of the moment. Whatever happens, there’s only one certainty: It will not go exactly as you expect. So expect nothing, but be prepared for anything. Relax and trust your body’s wisdom. It will respond on it’s own.</em></p><h3>A little bit fear could be helpful</h3><p>Think about fear as a tool, it reminds us that something particular will happen. But it is <strong>not more than an alarm clock</strong>. We should use as a tool, and we should not let to dominate our thoughts. If the next step seems to be very scary,
    but your sense tells you, that it is the right thing, never listen to the fear, because <strong>it is temporary, it will pass away</strong>.</p><h3>Open your mind</h3><p>Focusing means “Being in the present” to me, but never focus on particular things, because if you immersed in that thing, you will lose the opportunities that are outside your focus. Some years ago, I saw a TED presentation called The puzzle of motivation.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FrrkrvAUbU9Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrrkrvAUbU9Y&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FrrkrvAUbU9Y%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=b7d04c9b404c499eba89ee7072e1c4f7&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube"

The outcome was, that if somebody has a direct reward (money), their focus narrowed, so they were not able to solve the problem. For
    <strong>narrowed focus people are hard to step out from the circle</strong>, they are not open minded. </p><h3>The “How” is as important as the outcome</h3><picture>

</picture><p><em>Volunteers were recruited for a lab experiment investigating “learning” (re: ethics: deception). Participants were 40 males, aged between 20 and 50, whose jobs ranged from unskilled to professional.</em></p><p><em>At the beginning of the experiment they were introduced to another participant, who was actually a confederate of the experimenter (Milgram). They drew straws to determine their roles – <strong>learner</strong> or <strong>teacher</strong> – although this was fixed and the confederate always ended to the learner. There was also an “experimenter” dressed in a white lab coat, played by an actor (not Milgram).</em></p><p><em>The <strong>learner</strong> (Mr. Wallace) was strapped to a chair in another room with electrodes. After he has learned a list of word pairs given him to learn, the “teacher” tests him by naming a word and asking the learner to recall its partner/pair from a list of four possible choices.</em></p><p><em>The <strong>teacher</strong> is told to administer an electric shock every time the learner makes a mistake, increasing the level of shock each time. There were 30 switches on the shock generator marked from 15 volts (slight shock) to 450 (danger – severe shock).</em></p><p><em>The <strong>learner</strong> gave mainly wrong answers (on purpose) and for each of these the <strong>teacher</strong> gave him an electric shock. When the teacher refused to <strong>administer</strong> a shock and turned to the experimenter for guidance, he was given the standard instruction /order (consisting of 4 prods):</em></p><p><em>Prod 1: “Please continue.”<br>Prod 2: “The experiment requires you to continue.”<br>Prod 3: “It is absolutely essential that you continue.”<br>Prod 4: “You have no other choice but to continue.”</em></p><h3>Results</h3><p><strong>65%</strong> (two-thirds) of participants (i.e. teachers) continued to the highest level of 450 volts. <strong>All the participants continued to 300 volts.</strong><br>Milgram did more than one experiment – he carried out 18 variations of his
    study. All he did was alter the situation to see how this affected obedience.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The results are shocking, this means that <strong>ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being</strong>.<br>Most of the people are instruction follower, which could be
    very dangerous, because we can harm people, without any remorse. Don’t be a sheep.</p><picture>

</picture><p>A lot of people think that coincidences are things that we should not need to care about, they say coincidences are just happening. The only interesting thing, that we pay general attention to these “nothings”. Somehow we feel, that something strange
    happening, like a bug in the matrix.</p><p>The nature of these events are simply inscrutable, there is no point to count or measure them, but we all know we should do something with them.</p><p><em>First let me tell you a true story happened to<strong> Anthony Hopkins</strong>.</em></p><picture>

</picture><p><em>In 1973, Anthony Hopkins accepted the starring role in George Feifer’s The Girl from Petrovka, based on the book by the same name. He traveled to London to buy a copy of the book. Unfortunately, none of the main London bookstores had a copy.</em></p><p><em>Giving up, he set off for home. On his way, waiting for an underground train at Leicester Square tube station, he saw a discarded book lying on the seat next to him. It was a copy of The Girl from Petrovka.</em></p><p><em>Two years later, when he had a chance to meet the author, Feifer said that in November 1971 he had lent a friend a copy of the book—a uniquely annotated copy in which he had made notes on turning the British English into American English (“labour” to “labor,” and so on)—but his friend had lost the copy in Bayswater, London. Hopkins pulled out his copy, he found. “<strong>This one?</strong>” he asked.</em></p><p>We live in a world of coincidences, but these coincidences are created and driven by our mind, our intention and our feelings. Some of the people called it synchronicity, when the things happening in the right place at the right time, when we are in sync
    with our own intentions.</p><p>Did you ever met with somebody twice at the same day in the corridor, did you imagined somebody in your mind and he suddenly called you? These people have a “message” to you, it does not matter whether you know them.</p><p>There could be signs like an familiar animal, a plant, that may appear in a specific time, to draw your attention to something. For myself this is the philodendron plant.</p><p>Sudden thoughts, that you would like to read a book, you have almost forget, or <strong>if you are in front of a decision</strong>, it is always good compare the two alternative routes, <strong>the good choice will look</strong><strong>brighter</strong>,
    and the small hints will reveal it.</p><picture>

</picture><p>Life is limited in time. We grow up, experience a lot, we learn what we love, but most of the times we learn to love things that others (or culture) suggest to love.</p><p>When someone is asking the above question “What Are We Supposed To Do In Life?”, means that he is open to experience more than just living day by day. You are ready for more.</p><h2>First is first</h2><p>Collect things <strong>you</strong> love to do in your life, these are mainly everyday activities, be as precise as you can. I give some hints:</p><ol>
    <li>Play/Make music</li>
    <li>DIY</li>
    <li>Painting, Arts</li>
    <li>Writing stories either blog, science book, drama, screenplay</li>
    <li>Teaching or mentoring</li>
    <li>Being in the nature, taking care about plants</li>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Speaking or going out with friends</li>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Others</li>
</ol><p>For example I love cooking, I like to watch others cooking too, healthy, spicy foods from all over the world. I am not vegetarian, but I know what healthy food means. Someone said in the past:</p><blockquote>
    <p>You are what you eat .</p>
</blockquote><h2>Eliminate things that are not you</h2><p>Remember what your parents said in your childhood ‘don’t do this and that’ or that you learned at school ‘you are not smart enough to do that’ or even your friends hinted ‘you should not go out with that girl’. These barriers and habits are not you.</p><p>There is nothing bad in trying out new things, you are adult in a sense of choices, you can make now your own decisions.</p><p>For example in my childhood I was told in the school that I could not speak in public, because I was introvert. Some years later at my workplace I gave a public presentation about Project Management to about 100 people.</p><h2>Find things you specially like</h2><p>You remember moments in your life, that was special? Collect them</p><ol>
    <li>Sitting next to the fire</li>
    <li>Giving surprise to someone without any reason</li>
    <li>Smell of you grandmother’s house</li>
    <li>Lying on your back in high grass in the middle of nowhere</li>
    <li>Seeing your friend smiling</li>
    <li>Light a candle</li>
    <li>Steam of fresh coffee and a lot of other things</li>
</ol><p>Finding special things helps you to discover the world around you. Helps you to listen.</p><h2>Accept yourself as you are</h2><p>You are not a bad human, everyone has bad moments, angry afternoons, bad habits, just accept yourself.</p><blockquote>
    <p>Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them – Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote><p>No, it is not an easy task, you should do this day by day. You should accept more things you would realize, you body shape, you voice tone, your thoughts, your intentions, even your bad habits, everything that is described as you.</p><h2>The reason of your life?</h2><p>Most of the people said, that you are because some God decided to be here. I can tell you that very spirit was <strong>you</strong>, who decided to be here.</p><blockquote>
    <p>Explore yourself, in your actions, in your decisions, in the music you hear, in the people who are surrounding you.</p>
</blockquote><p>You can either choose to work your dream work and express your feelings, thoughts in your work or you can have a hobby. Take time for important things holiday, having rest, going out.</p><p>There is nothing enlightened in going to a monastery among people you are not knowing or meditating all day long. Meditate on the train you will traveling with, during reading a book. If you have some idea, make it real, you want to travel to New Zealand,
    travel in the next week.</p><blockquote>
    <p>Just be.</p>
</blockquote><p>Only the sky could be the limit.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --></div></section><section id="section-Gallery2colWords-2ace8c5e-3a4e-49f8-a156-771ee9ce628e" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-xsmall color-title p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="Component p-1 col-2 m-a col-w-50p ms-w-100p col-gap-0 d-b  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="47"><!-- react-empty: 48 --><!-- react-empty: 49 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="50"><h1 data-reactid="51"><span class="" data-reactid="52"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="53">Twins Who Are Completely Strangers To Each Other</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 54 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="55"><p>Did you ever imagined, that there is an identical person somewhere in the world, who looks exactly like you?

</picture><h3>1. What is the meaning of live?</h3><p>During our life, we face this situation that we have no direction to go. We should find</p><p>The big philosophers and religious people tried to answer this question over the centuries.</p><blockquote>
    <p><strong>Platon</strong> thought that the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge.</p>
    <p><strong>Stoicism</strong> said the meaning of life is to free from suffering.</p>
    <p>In the schools of <strong>Hinduism</strong>, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of karma (causal action), sansara (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and moksha (liberation).</p>
    <p>In <strong>Tenrikyo </strong>(new religion), one is expected to live a Joyous Life by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.</p>
</blockquote><p>Most people think in the western countries, that we should <strong>achieve happiness</strong> in our life. The controversial thing in this concept is that happiness itself is a state, and more often comes from situations, where we did not expect it (a
    smile, a hug). However we set a bunch of goals, and we associate happiness with these goals.</p><p>People trying to reach happiness so badly that they are all unhappy in their life.</p><p>There are also people, who are saying this question is like “Why grass is green?”, we are existing because it just happened.</p><p>Anyway there is a lot of help and inspiration if we find some kind of meaning.</p><picture>

</picture><p>A 2014 year <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/11/12/1408988111.full.pdf">study</a> performed by University College London suggests that <strong>most people would rather harm themselves than a stranger for profit</strong>.</p><blockquote>
    <p>We were interested in quantifying how much people care about others, relative to themselves.</p>
</blockquote><h1>The Experiment</h1><blockquote>
    <p>We brought 80 pairs of volunteers in to the lab and led them to different rooms so they couldn’t see or talk to each other. They drew lots to determine which would be the “decider”, and which the “receiver”. The decider then made a series of decisions
        between different amounts of money and different amounts of moderately painful electric shocks. The decider always received the money, but sometimes the shocks were for the decider, and sometimes the shocks were for the receiver. By observing
        the deciders’ choices we were able to calculate how much money they were willing to sacrifice to prevent shocks to either themselves or to the receiver.</p>
</blockquote><h1>The Results</h1><blockquote>
    <p>We found that on average, people were willing to sacrifice about twice as much money to prevent another person from being shocked, than to prevent themselves from being shocked. So for example, they would give up £8 to prevent 20 shocks to another
        person but would only give up £4 to prevent 20 shocks to themselves.</p>
</blockquote><p>From altruistic point of view we find a lot of examples in everyday life when people are doing something not for themselves but to another human being. When we say ‘I am’ we have two important parts the so called ‘Ego’ and the ‘Inner Self’. In everyday
    life our Ego drives our wishes, but if we find some harmony between our two selves the Inner Self could come in the front, and the behaviour like altruism appears. It is because our Inner Self is not really self centric. In a way we are all connected.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="177"><!-- react-empty: 178 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="179"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="180"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="181"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="182"><span data-reactid="183"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="184"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ddba1464-2ea0-42cd-8d3e-20396e7c6979.png" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="185"/></a><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="186"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="187">Positive Thinking For Everyday Life</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="188"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="189"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="190"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
