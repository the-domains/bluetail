<p>Do you remember the game dodgeball in your childhood? Life works exactly as dodgeball, there are four ways to act:</p><ol><li>The ball strikes you, because you did not have the good reaction</li><li>You avoid the hit, just by step away from the path of the ball</li><li>You try to catch the ball, but it falls out from your hands</li><li>You catch the ball, because your hands absorbs the energy of the throw</li></ol><p>The most successful players are able to catch the ball. They understand, that they should not stand tensely, rather being relaxed and act according to the situation.</p><p>In his book Dan Millman explains the above with his character Socrates, who learned to fight from his teacher Serafin:</p><p><em>- Please, Serafim, I don’t need you to constantly remind me to relax and breathe. I understand your point!<br>- <strong>Doing is understanding </strong>– Serafim said.</em><br><em>- In combat, there’s no time to think. Beforehand, you may plan and strategize, but all plans are tentative and must change on the spur of the moment. Whatever happens, there’s only one certainty: It will not go exactly as you expect. So expect nothing, but be prepared for anything. Relax and trust your body’s wisdom. It will respond on it’s own.</em></p><h3>A little bit fear could be helpful</h3><p>Think about fear as a tool, it reminds us that something particular will happen. But it is <strong>not more than an alarm clock</strong>. We should use as a tool, and we should not let to dominate our thoughts. If the next step seems to be very scary, but your sense tells you, that it is the right thing, never listen to the fear, because <strong>it is temporary, it will pass away</strong>.</p><h3>Open your mind</h3><p>Focusing means “Being in the present” to me, but never focus on particular things, because if you immersed in that thing, you will lose the opportunities that are outside your focus. Some years ago, I saw a TED presentation called The puzzle of motivation.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FrrkrvAUbU9Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrrkrvAUbU9Y&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FrrkrvAUbU9Y%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=b7d04c9b404c499eba89ee7072e1c4f7&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>In the presentation Dan Pink explained “the candle problem”, where a complex task should be solved by the participants. The outcome was, that if somebody has a direct reward (money), their focus narrowed, so they were not able to solve the problem. For <strong>narrowed focus people are hard to step out from the circle</strong>, they are not open minded. </p><h3>The “How” is as important as the outcome</h3><picture>
