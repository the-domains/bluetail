### 2\. Have A Vision -- Do Not Have A Work, Have A Mission

Imagine the **ideal** world that you would like to live in. In a vision everything is possible, there are no barriers. Write down imagine your vision, wake up if you would like to achieve it.

Most people just "work", but there are a some people who see their job as a **mission**. They believe in what they do.

Choose an aspect in your life to get better every day, it could have anything, not just work related.

Most people say "I am worthless", however they have a very nice family with a house, they have happy life. What you have achieved is something that nobody could steal from you. It is yours.
