  A new study performed by University College London suggests that most people
  would rather harm themselves than a stranger for profit. We were interested in
  quantifying how much people care about others, relative to themselves. We
  brought 80 pairs of volunteers in to the lab and led them to different rooms
  so they couldn't see or talk to each other.
