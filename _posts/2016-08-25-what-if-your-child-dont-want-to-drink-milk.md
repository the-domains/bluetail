Use a simple mind trick, lets see an example:

If you want to get your child to drink milk, you will say the following:

"Do you want to drink a cup of milk?" and the answer would be "No"

Now use magic, and say the following:

**"Do you want the milk in a blue cup or a red cup?"**

...and he'll choose a colour and drink his milk!
